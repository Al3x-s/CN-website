            Hey, I'm Alejandro (Alex) Sanchez the biggest Tech enthusiast you'll
            meet.<br />
            I currently spend my days between school, writing scripts, and
            growing my <br />
            web development business kabin.tech. I believe technology has the
            power to<br />
            evolve not just humans but the world as we know it. My dreams are to
            mix my<br />
            passion for business and computer science and own a cybersecurity
            firm or <br />
            grow my web development business to a level capable of competing
            with the <br />
            biggest name companies out there. I believe that my hunger for
            knowledge is<br />
            what makes me a great candidate. when I have an unanswered question
            or have<br />
            trouble doing work, I work my hardest to try and solve the problem.
            For example,<br />
            I pushed my limits in March of this year with a team of 5 people
            where we worked<br />
            for 12 straight hours to propose a math model about the growth of
            the use of <br />
            electric trucks, and industry growth over the next 30 years. it was
            one of the<br />
            most grueling challenges, however, the feeling of completing a model
            and using<br />
            it to approximate data, in the end, was worth the world to me.
